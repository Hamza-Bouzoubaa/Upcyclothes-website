Product Name: Upcyclothes

Product Description:

Our group aims to create a service primarily based in Ottawa,
Our service is aimed at tackling the Clothes Wastage issue. Our business aims to collaborate with organizations that upcycle clothing. We would be providing transportation of donated clothing to these organizations. In addition, we have a three step process of sorting the clothing based on their usability, with the abundance of the clothing going to our partnered organizations. Our primary method of obtaining clothing is through the donation of clothing. In the future, we wish to develop an app that allows those who have donated clothing to see how their donated items are being handled and how they are being upcycled.
