                        upcycling, nearing the waste level. These fabrics are used for many other uses that don't
                        necessarily involve making new clothes.
                        A few of these uses include:
                        Accessories, Toys and Filling bean bags and mattresses

            <h3>What can you do?</h3>
            <p>We offer a quick and easy solution to upcycle your clothes.
                Along with the assurance that it's going to the right place i.e not being dumped in a landfill or worse,
                burnt. <br>
                We plan to accomplish that with our unique 3 level system: <br>
                1. We collect clothes, easing the process of people who are trying to do the right thing, <br>
                2. We sort them into three levels of usability, <br>
                3. We keep clothes that are unsusable in their current state <br>
                4. Transport the rest to certified organizations who upcycle clothes and restore them, ensuring that
                they share our values, and vision.
